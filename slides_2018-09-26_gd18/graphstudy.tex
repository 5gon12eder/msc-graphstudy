    This paper addresses the following basic question: given two layouts of the same graph, which one is more
    aesthetically pleasing? We propose a neural network-based discriminator model trained on a labeled dataset that
    decides which of two layouts has a higher aesthetic quality. The feature vectors used as inputs to the model are
    based on known graph drawing quality metrics, classical statistics, information-theoretical quantities, and
    two-point statistics inspired by methods of condensed matter physics. The large corpus of layout pairs used for
    training and testing is constructed using force-directed drawing algorithms and the layouts that naturally stem from
    the process of graph generation. It is further extended using data augmentation techniques. Our model demonstrates a
    mean prediction accuracy of $\XValSuccessMean\percent$, outperforming discriminators based on stress and on the
    linear combination of popular quality metrics by a small but statistically significant margin.
