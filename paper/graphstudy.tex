\begin{abstract}
  This paper addresses the following basic question: given two layouts of the same graph, which one is more
  aesthetically pleasing? We propose a neural network-based discriminator model trained on a labeled dataset that
  decides which of two layouts has a higher aesthetic quality. The feature vectors used as inputs to the model are based
  on known graph drawing quality metrics, classical statistics, information-theoretical quantities, and two-point
  statistics inspired by methods of condensed matter physics. The large corpus of layout pairs used for training and
  testing is constructed using force-directed drawing algorithms and the layouts that naturally stem from the process of
  graph generation. It is further extended using data augmentation techniques. Our model demonstrates a mean prediction
  accuracy of $\XValSuccessMean\percent$, outperforming discriminators based on stress and on the linear combination of
  popular quality metrics by a small but statistically significant margin.
