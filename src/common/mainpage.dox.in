/// This is the documentation of the internal C++ API used by the code written for
/// [my Master's thesis](@MSC_PACKAGE_URL@).
///
/// The graph data structures and layouting algorithms are from the
/// [Open Graph Drawing Framework (OGDF)](http://www.ogdf.net/) which is a prequisite for building and using this
/// library.  Furthermore, [Boost 1.66](http://www.boost.org/) or later is required.
///
/// This library is not really meant to be useful to anyone else though you are welcome to re-use (obeying the licensing
/// terms) parts of it if you find them useful.  No attempt has been made to make the feature-set provided by this
/// library complete.  I have only implemented what was needed in order to get my work done.  The only really value of
/// this documentation is probably to understand more rapidly what the code for my thesis is doing, if you feel so
/// inclined.
